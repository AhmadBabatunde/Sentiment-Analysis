GREATEST CISSAITES!

Warren Bennis says “Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." 

As an honorable with connections to Faculty stakeholders, I have encountered, accumulated knowledge, learned, and comprehended the requirements, strategies, and crucial choices essential for fortifying the Faculty as a robust and remarkable one, while also harnessing extraordinary capabilities.

In lieu to the aforementioned, I, *MUH’QOOZIM MUH’JAMIU ADEMOLA A.K.A GIFTED* humbly offer myself to serve as a Students’ Union Senator, representing the Faculty of Communication and Information Sciences at the Senate Council. 

I ask for your mandate and support. My commitment is to you, the Exceptional Potentials. You are the reason I want to represent this great faculty so that we can continue to enhance capacity. If granted this chance, I assure you my unwavering commitment to the betterment of CISSAITES.

I will be an advocate for inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that all voices, regardless of background, are heard and respected.

Helen Keller's wisdom echoes, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much”. This collaborative spirit is at the heart of effective leadership.
 I call on CISSAITES to come together, let’s get it done.

Vote *GIFTED* as *SENATOR* representing faculty of CIS 🔰🔰🔰

Long live CIS !!!
Long live UNILORIN !!!

*_Uniting Vision, amplifying our voice to greatness_*✨

You have to pick atleast 3 senators for your faculty, let *GIFTED* @2349066067020 be the first person you pick, he has represented us well in the SRC, I believe so much he will do better in the SU council. Pls and pls. Get to know him better now. This is our only option as this department to have someone to represent us, let’s not bottle it.

8/14/23, 3:59 PM - +234 906 606 7020: Tutorial created by the faculty Gen sec.
8/14/23, 3:59 PM - +234 806 429 4069: We should be our brothers keeper, and we need a strong stand on this politics level as we have not been an active participant in the past years. We are ready to make that stand now. Please, our department should always come first. Do well in supporting all CSC candidates be it your level or not.
8/14/23, 3:59 PM - +234 907 479 7837: When we were craving for tutorials, he was communicating online as physical presence is not compulsory 😂😂
8/14/23, 4:00 PM - +234 806 429 4069: 🤣
8/14/23, 4:00 PM - +234 818 072 1688: <Media omitted>
8/14/23, 4:00 PM - +234 702 531 4841: We didn't or notice any tutorial 
Are u talking Abt first semester?
8/14/23, 4:00 PM - Optimistic Class Rep: If you were here when complaint was made about some certain things in the faculty which y’all must have noticed the changes, he was the one you tabled the matter to on the group that day which he presented to the house.
Few complained about Wi-Fi, issues with light in the LR and around the faculty and others, which he tabled to the house as the honorable representing computer science constituency. His contributions are not the one that can be publicized because he’s among the legislative arms of the faculty.  He’s one core of those that uphold the law of the constitution and didn’t make this department drag back in the faculty.
Now that you’ve heard his contribution, I’d like to know the reasons why you’d not vote for him? He has little power, let’s think of giving him more and see what he can do.
8/14/23, 4:01 PM - +234 906 606 7020: There was no one that make complain about it to the department, that’s why we didn’t get to know.
8/14/23, 4:01 PM - +234 907 479 7837: Ok.. You've spoken well🐒
8/14/23, 4:01 PM - +234 902 871 9738: That's why everything needs to be solve now, the foundation has to be solid
8/14/23, 4:01 PM - Optimistic Class Rep: He’s not in charge to hold tutorials for anyone, he’s not a scholar, he’s only an honorable, he only can suggest, he can’t mandate things and make it work compulsorily.
I really wish y’all know how this works, maybe we will be aligned a little on this.
8/14/23, 4:01 PM - +234 806 429 4069: Exactly
8/14/23, 4:02 PM - +234 907 237 3007: Hate to sound like a geek

8/14/23, 4:04 PM - +234 704 981 2103: PHY 252 past questions 😒😒

8/14/23, 4:06 PM - Optimistic Class Rep: Few people here can relate on how I personally have been battling with many tutorials work for us and 100levels but is really really hard. Tutors are turning me down which I completely understand, when tutors are available, 100Ls are busy, I have my own personal test and exam to focus on. It’s really hard but then, we have to look on the positive sides and make this work for us.
8/14/23, 4:07 PM - +234 704 981 2103: PHY 252 PAST QUESTIONS!!!
8/14/23, 4:07 PM - +234 702 531 4841: Let's be honest most of them isn't doin anything. So it's better to chose one representative from our department that we can talk to freely
8/14/23, 4:07 PM - Optimistic Class Rep: I really understand my boss
I’m even happy this convo is happening now. It’s supposed too. There are things we need some clarifications on.

8/14/23, 4:08 PM - +234 702 531 4841: I'm not interested in politics boss😹
8/14/23, 4:08 PM - +234 907 479 7837: OH...YES
8/14/23, 4:09 PM - Optimistic Class Rep: I really like that you love to get clarified my man. This is our person, they have been choosing and mandating for us here, let’s have a person above too that will work in our favor 🤲

Beloved CISSAITES,

I am deeply moved by the incredible affection and encouragement you have generously showered upon me in light of my pursuit to become the forthcoming senator representing CIS. I am sincerely appreciative of this overwhelming show of support.

Kindly join me in ceasing all campaign materials and visuals, as campaigning is set to be prohibited starting tomorrow morning at 7 am.

I kindly request that you remove all graphics associated with Gifted from your status and profile pictures. Let us promptly suspend all campaign activities to ensure we steer clear of any risk of disqualification.

My heartfelt gratitude to you all once more.

Warm regards,
*GIFTED*

*Are their track records verifiable?*

🫵🫵You wil determine who that leader will be today.

Suzy Kassem quote " *Most of the time, we see only what we want to see, or what others tell us to see, instead of really investigate to see what is really there.* " 

The below names  have been scrutinized by the faculty and I'll tell you for free they are competent and determined to work in our own favor ( *DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE* ) and push the faculty to the next level which we all will be beneficiary of.

They just need your support 🙏🙏🙏

*Optimist*😊
*Muslimah*💪
*Seguncodes*🙂
*Antonio*😄
*Jimmy d Oracle*😀
 *Elitech*🙇‍♂️

 *Please come out* 

Anywhere you see those names👆.

8/23/23, 7:45 AM - +234 806 429 4069: Good morning everyone, the clashing of GSE and CSC216, I think the course rep should inform Dr Hamzat ahead that is clashing with her work in case she do not  see us early and her exam venue.
Because CBT won't accept any form of lateness as they will be following faculty by faculty.
I suggest if there's no exam at CISLT in the morning, maybe we should do CSC216 In the morning before the time of GSE or she change it to evening after GSE.
Because I don't think we will be able to make the two at a time. Is not everyone that will be able to enter CBT at once and come out at once.

8/25/23, 3:08 PM - TheTerabyte: Explain how priority interrupt works to a teenager:


Imagine you're in a classroom, and your teacher is explaining something to the class. Sometimes, another student might raise their hand because they have an important question that needs to be answered right away. In this situation, the teacher might pause what they were saying to address the urgent question. That's a bit like how priority interrupts work in computers.

In a computer, there are different tasks happening at the same time, like running programs, sending data to devices, and more. Just like in the classroom, some tasks are more important or urgent than others. Priority interrupts are like raised hands from different tasks, telling the computer that they need attention immediately.

When a task with a higher priority interrupts the computer, it's as if the computer stops what it's doing and focuses on the important task. Just like the teacher taking a break from the lesson to answer the urgent question. Once the high-priority task is done, the computer goes back to what it was doing before, just like the teacher goes back to explaining the lesson.

So, priority interrupts help the computer manage different tasks by allowing important tasks to "interrupt" less important ones temporarily. It's a way to make sure that the most urgent things get taken care of quickly, kind of like how teachers handle important questions in a classroom full of students.

9/19/23, 7:45 AM - Optimistic Class Rep: Good morning Computer Science Penultimates ❤️

The end of 200 level exam yesterday marks the end of old phase and beginning of new phase.

You should be proud of the energy and efforts you put into this and for coming this far, it’s not been easy but you didn’t include giving up in your options.

Nonetheless, there’s more to do, we’re almost there, as much as you enjoy and have fun during your break, prepare for what’s coming too. Guide and bob, replan and restrategize, there’s room for improvement.

Y’all deserve the enjoyment you get this period, I wish say I fit press una money 🌚😂

Have a great break cos it ain’t an holiday yet. Safest journey to those who are traveling 🤲❤️

9/25/23, 9:12 AM - +234 906 606 7020: Hello guys!

Glad you're all crossing over to 300L.

A little bit of advice would do so you can optimize your holiday season ahead of resumption.

1. If you haven't learnt a programming language yet or haven't found your way into the tech space yet, it's advisable that you make use of this holiday to do so. 

It's not too late, figure out what you want to do..and learn the required programming language(s) for it

2. There are some courses that might prove to be a challenge, but not to scare you...dedicate some extra time to it and you'll conquer e.g a). _Data Structure and Algorithms_ b). _Automata Theory of Computability_
9/25/23, 9:12 AM - +234 906 606 7020: It's important to have knowledge of a programming language to properly understand DSA, so do that this holiday if you don't have any.
9/25/23, 9:13 AM - +234 906 606 7020: As for Automata, I'll send in a playlist on YouTube that'll make the concept of Automata easier to grasp/understand.
9/25/23, 9:13 AM - +234 906 606 7020: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgp46KUv4ZY69yXmpwKOIev
9/25/23, 9:13 AM - +234 906 606 7020: For this playlist, you don't have to watch everything in there...

I'll send a list of the topics to guide you on the videos to watch.
9/25/23, 9:13 AM - +234 906 606 7020: *AUTOMATA*

1. Introduction to theory of computation

2. Finite State Machines

3. Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

4.  Regular Languages

5. Non Deterministic Finite Automata(NFA)

6. Conversion of NFA to DFA

7. Epsilon NFA (E-NFA)

8. Conversion of E-NFA to NFA

9. Conversion of Regular expressions to Finite Automata

10. Pumping Lemma

11. Ambiguous Grammar

12. Push Down Automata

13. Turing Machines

I have been a normal student who knows how the Public Relations Officer works. Some we dislike, some we love.
*If Elected as The PRO I'll try to*
•	Increase student engagement. I will work to create new and exciting events and initiatives that will encourage students to get involved in the department executives and the campus community. I will also work to improve communication between student leaders and the student body.
•	 Advocate for student rights. I will work with the student government to lobby for new policies and programs that benefit students. I will also represent students in disputes with the administration.
•	 Finally, create a platform where student can express their feeling about the current administration and give in their idea. As we all know, our department doesn’t communicate well. This is one of the things I hope to improve.
Thanks, and God bless you all.

10/4/23, 9:29 AM - +234 702 531 4841: *MANIFESTO OF THE NACOS ASSISTANT GENERAL SECRETARY ASPIRANT*
Good day fellow esteemed NACOSite.

It is with great honour and privilege to be on this platform in the presence of the noble National Association of Computing Students (NACOS).

My name is Ezekiel Precious and I'm thrilled to present my manifesto as I aspire to become your Assistant General Secretary.
If I’m being elected to the office of Assistant General Secretary of this association, I will make a good difference in my community and to also take a proactive role in decisions made within our association.

During my course of passion for this post, I have served and still serving as the assistant class representative of my department. This duty has opened my eyes to qualities of being a good official and I also have learnt about the duties of the ordinary member differ from that of the assistant general secretary in the association and I pledge to contribute on ideas and abilities to the promotion of the values of NACOS.

Also, I will prioritize open and transparent communication, foster collaboration among members, and work towards creating a strong and inclusive community within NACOS.

It's my hope that I will be given the opportunity not only through your vote but also through your support to serve and take NACOS to greater heights.

If I’m being elected for this post, you all would be doing this association a great favor of choosing a leader who is dedicated, focused and committed to serve her community with a good working knowledge of meeting procedures, and awareness of the future direction and plans of the association.

Lastly, I'll perform my responsibilities such as scheduling management meetings, creating agendas, record minutes of meetings and also compile and distribute minutes of meetings to personnel.
I am also going to adhere strictly to the constitution of NACOS.

Together we can make NACOS an even more vibrant and thriving association.
So please cast your vote for me as your assistant general secretary and let's make a positive impact together.
Thank you for your trust and support.

As a public relations officer aspirant, I am thrilled to share with you my manifesto, expressing my passion and dedication to this role. 

*Building Strong Relationships:* I firmly believe in the power of building and nurturing relationships. I will strive to establish connections with key individuals, media outlets, neighboring departments and the school community at large. By fostering trust and open communication, I aim to create lasting partnerships that benefit all parties involved.

*Effective Communication:* As we all know that _communication is at the heart of public relations_. I will utilize various channels, including traditional and digital media, to effectively convey messages and promote positive narratives. Whether it's crafting compelling press releases, managing social media platforms, or organizing engaging events, I will ensure that the right message reaches the right audience.

*Promoting a Positive Image:* A positive image is crucial for any organization or individual. I have, in my few years as a member of this department kept a positive image and will work tirelessly to enhance and maintain a favorable public perception. Through strategic storytelling, reputation management, and proactive engagement, I will showcase the strengths, values, and achievements of the department I represent.

*Media Relations:* As I mentioned earlier,building strong relationships with the media is vital in today's fast-paced world. I will establish connections with journalists, editors, and influencers, ensuring that accurate and positive information reaches the public. I will proactively engage with the media, facilitating interviews, press conferences, and media coverage to amplify the desired messages.

*Crisis Management:* In the face of challenges and crises, I will remain calm, composed, and proactive. I will develop robust crisis communication plans, enabling swift and effective responses. By providing accurate information, managing public perception, and demonstrating transparency, I will help navigate through difficult times while minimizing reputational damage.

*Transparency and Integrity:* Transparency and integrity are the cornerstones of ethical public relations. I will always prioritize honesty, authenticity, and accountability in all my interactions. By upholding the highest ethical standards, I will build trust and credibility with stakeholders and the public.

So i have a form i would love you help fill

Thanks guys
Its a product design project
11/5/23, 9:18 AM - +234 906 570 6942: Hi guys, 

So recently I boarded a bus in Lagos and due to being my first time going to that location, I didn't know the amount for the fare and after alighting from the bus I realized I paid twice the transport fare.🥲🥲

This pushed me to solve that problem with a project tagged "Journey Pal" which would give users access to directions (map) and also price range from one location to another.

I would like you also fill out this form with the link below:

There’s an upcoming tech conference at the Babcock university titled TECHXPLORE – THE BUCC TECH CONVENTION that’s scheduled to hold on the 19th of November 2023 to the 25th of November 2023. 

It’s a first of it’s kind event that’s organized by the Babcock University Computer Club (BUCC) and it is slated to hold for a week. 

Few universities were invited and luckily for us, we were among the shortlisted. 
It’s going to be a fun week of developing, building, designing and most importantly networking with the right people already in the industry. 

The team has been assembled, however due to the requirements, we are in need of an additional female to make the team complete. 

It’s a free event and your accommodation and feeding during your 1 week stay will be taken care of by BUCC. 

I’ll be attaching the invitations and also some terms and conditions, so kindly go through it throughly to have a proper understanding. 

If you’re interested, kindly reach out immediately as preparations has to be made.

11/13/23, 10:38 AM - +234 907 076 6308: Hello guys!

I hope you are enjoying your holidays and preparing for school.

I'm here to give you an important piece of advice and I'd implore you to take it with seriousness.

There's a course you will be taking in 300L - CSC 311 (Automata). Some of you here may have heard about it.

If you do know what's good for you, I'd advice you to start reading ahead and practicing. The course is quite tough and tricky and it'll pay you to practice it ahead of your lectures.

The chances of failing the course is still fairly high even if you know it very well compared to you not knowing it at all.

I was able to do tutorials for the last 300L set but unfortunately I wouldn't be in Ilorin so hopefully there would be someone to take you guys from the new 400L set

Here's a playlist I used during my time that got me my A.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgp46KUv4ZY69yXmpwKOIev&si=9c1CCFXXuNIHKO_K

Make sure to practice all possible types of questions under a topic and you'll be good to go
11/13/23, 10:43 AM - Momore: Thank you sir 🫂
11/13/23, 10:46 AM - +234 907 076 6308: One more thing.

Before I forget.

Please after 300L...try not to forget the course and keep revising.

You will meet it again in 400L in two different courses.

Excellent unilorites,

in anticipation of the resumption of the academic session which starts on monday, december 4th, 2023, we have actively facilitated the early opening and allocation process of university-owned hostels to ensure that our esteemed students are comfortably settled and well-prepared for their academic endeavors.

I'm excited to share that my latest article on Gladia is live!

This piece explores the limitations of the original OpenAI Whisper model for long audio files and provides a short tutorial on using Gladia to overcome these challenges.

I'd love your feedback! Let me know what you think.

It comes with jp notebook, jp lab, Spyder etc
1/2/24, 5:06 PM - +234 806 429 4069: The one you sent is like taking me through the interface of Jupyter notebook.
As in, I never get the chance to install the Jupyter itself.
Have tried using python(command prompt ) and now I downloaded Anaconda again (showing directory error or something like that)
I will screenshot it and send

It'll show some random code about the startup for probably a second or two, depending on your system, then it'll open and you'd select a folder to open a new notebook and start work <This message was edited>
1/2/24, 5:11 PM - +234 706 235 2856: Run it 
Sha hold like 8gb if you are using airtel, they are using it with you 😂
1/2/24, 5:12 PM - +234 706 235 2856: Select a folder that you can easily access and store your data sets also because they need to be in the same folder as the notebook

1/6/24, 7:12 PM - Ayomide Brandpadre: Thank you boss
1/6/24, 7:41 PM - Emmanuel: Good Evening Dear Esteemed Colleagues,

Thank you for your attendance en masse at today's meeting. Please kindly note the following important information:

1. Starting from Monday, Trainers' details will be put out in the public for students to pick skills from. So, please, be informed and prepared for the buzz. 

2. The first and most important and urgent information to be passed across to the students is that of TECASBE Global Entrepreneurship Innovation Week.

*Payment*: Please, kindly circulate and emphasize on the information that they would be required to pay a sum of #2500 for the TECASBE Global Entrepreneurship Innovation Summit to this account:👇
 *Account name: ASBE Innovation. Account number: 1026490194. Bank:UBA.* 

*Submission of receipt*: Having paid, a copy of receipt of payment is to be printed and submitted along with the form not later than *Monday 15th January, 2024* 

 *Test Assessment* : The students are to note that their payment and participation in TEC ASBE Global  Entrepreneurship Innovation week is part of their continuous assessment for GSE 301 and it is different from their practical training,  which will start after the programme, thus, full attendance of the  TEC ASBE Entrepreneurship Global Innovation Summit is compulsory for all GSE 301 students. 

Form Filling and Submission: To participate in the *TECASBE  ENTREPRENEURSHIP UNILORIN INNOVATION SUMMIT*,  it is compulsory for all GSE 301 students to fill the Innovation form that will be given to them by the trainers of their choice of skills as the communiqué from the form assessment will be submitted by TEC for the Global Entrepreneurship week programme.However, before filling the forms, each student is expected to *first and foremost make a photocopy of the form* . This is because they will be required to cut out a portion on the first page of the form which will serve as a TAG  with their peculiar identification number that they will use  to participate in all the summit activities including the raffle draw. *Please Note* that it is very important for students to make a photocopy before filling the form. 

 *Opportunities* : There lies two opportunities for every student. 1. To pitch a *StartUp* for a *new* business idea and win *300,000.00* or  2. To pitch for  *ScaleUp* of an *existing* business and win *500,000.00* 

Applicants  for *ScaleUp* will fill *Part A* . While  applicants for *Startup* , will fill *Part B.* 

 The General Part is for everybody to fill and this is the main theoretical part of  GSE 301 general Continuous Assessment (CA).  (i.e.*The first four questions is general and compulsory for all GSE 301 students to fill*.)

The form is expected to be filled and submitted back to the trainers latest by the close of work on the 15th of January,2024,  with evidence of payment *Kindly note this*. 

We expect that by next week, all hands should be on deck for us to have a successful outing.

 Another very important notice: There shall be a *Rally* for awareness of the TECASBE  Global Entrepreneurship Innovation week holding on *Wednesday,* the *10th* of January. Take off point shall be at the *roundabout right in front of the Senate Building* . Dress code is Jeans and White Shirt (Round neck,Polo,Packing Shirt,Blouse,anything white top) and Sneakers. *Let us also mobilize our students to be there* to increase our number. 

 Meeting time: *11:00am.* All GSE trainers are encouraged to be in attendance. It is expected to last for just one hour. Please, we crave your indulgence to make it down to the venue that day as the more the numbers, the more the attention we will be able to garner.

 This event is collectively owned by us all and *it's success is our success* . Remember, it's a global event and it's only when we give our best to it that it can be the best and God will surely reward our service to humanity. 

Thank you and God Bless

Yours faithfully, 

Mrs Patience Okwechime 
Unilorin TEC ASBE Coordinator.

1/6/24, 9:07 PM - Emmanuel: #2500 for TECASBE Global Entrepreneurship Innovation Week. #2500 for GSE 301 practical. The two payments are compulsory for all GSE 301 Students. You're advised to pay timely and hold your payment evidence in copies. It's also gathered that the payment is prerequisite to confirm the membership for some GSE skills, meaning that only those who pay early will be accommodated to those skills before the quota is exhausted. — *TRIPLEHAY*

1/17/24, 1:43 PM - GODFIRST! 🦁: Good morning my people, 

I can boldly tell you that what I sent to you now is the combination of what will give you a strong A depending on how you start reading it. 
The PDF by BENEFICENT and the one Delivered by BENEFICENT. If you start studying it from now. I can tell you that you're having 90+. Start reading, cramming and study the PQ. Don't wait till examination period. 
If you wait till exam, you won't be able to cover the two PDFs . Pls don't joke with this . It's sure PQ.

If you love your friends, send it to their DM. Don't send it when they won't be able to cover the PDF and they'll just read half.

In short , if you study the PQ from the beginning to the and you can answer all the questions. You can have 95. 

Ire o👍

I don't think we will do automata test because it's the time we're having GNS, so we can't do it and also the man just say we may! So no panic. For system programming, I was not in class but Teslimah said the lecturer said the rep should chat her to know the day we will do her test, so that means we can say we won't do it on Monday.
2/3/24, 4:32 PM - +234 806 429 4069: Toh
2/3/24, 4:34 PM - +234 816 205 8786: So, if we cooperate, we can make it happen like that i.e to only do GNS on Monday and do the rest later

2/10/24, 7:31 PM - Optimistic Class Rep: It was a tough one my fans. My contender pulled a very strong game, he played brilliantly well and I must give it to him but there only can be one winner and that’s ME, unarguably.

My contender gave in all he could but experience they say is the best teacher. He was schooled, I hope he learnt one or two today.

Till another day.

So we went to siwes office behind microfinance bank to ask for the letter. They asked us about our rep and said they can't be giving us one by one that we should all pay 1200naira to microfinance bank, give the receipts to the course rep and he will collect the letters and give us.
And everybody must have paid, give the original receipts to the rep and at the back of the receipt, you'll write your matric number, your full name, department and phone number. <This message was edited>

Make sure you make photocopy before you submit. So you can start submitting to any of us, that is Muslimah, Ruqoyat or Asmaa latest by Wednesday.

Finite automata

NFAs and E-NFAs  
If possible we will proceed to Mealy and Moore machines, just to cover ground so we will have less to do in preparation for presentations and tests. 
Oh I also skipped Grammars, We will do that and specially, @2348165389650 will do English grammar.

See it from this angle, life happens and what we’ll are dealing with is different what if I have one or two reasons not to come to school and I rely on my fellow colleagues on the group chat to always drop crucial details, we don’t know each other but we’re already bound to know one other because academy put us together, my message was a retaliation of anger and confusion ( I know you guys don’t care but if you care also that’s a win for you). Forget about all this bad belle people they love entertainment 😂. I’m a very cool guy and you’re also, no vex 🤝. Shout out to our cause rep @2347034945827 you try 💯.

_2022/2023 ACADEMIC SESSION_

*PRESS RELEASE*

24/02/2024
09:15PM

*ADJUSTED PRICING FOR KOROPE SHUTTLE SERVICE*

Excellent Unilorites,

After extensive deliberation and consultations with Korope drivers to revisit the pricing of Korope services in the University community, especially considering the fluctuations in fuel prices since the last review when it was at ₦410. 

Initially, the Korope Union proposed a rate of ₦400. However, after careful consideration, consolidation, and intervention by the Students' Union, the new price for Korope services has been set at ₦250, effective from Monday, February 26, 2024.

This decision aims to strike a balance that is fair to both the drivers and the students while ensuring the sustainability of all. We deeply appreciate your understanding and ongoing support as we navigate through these challenging economic circumstances together.

- Theory of Computation/ Computational Theories / Computation Automata Theory.

The theory of computation is a branch of computer science and mathematics combined that "deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm".
OR
A theoretical branch of Computer Science and Mathematics, which mainly deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as automata. 
OR
Theory of computation is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of general properties of computation and studies the inherent possibilities and limitations of efficient computation that makes machines more intelligent and enables them to carry out intellectual processes.

- The theory of computation is made up of 3 branches.They are:

Automata Theory - The study of abstract machines and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. (The abstract machines are known as automata. The automata theory was established by mathematicians in the 20th century and focuses on analyzing the behavior of machines and the manner in which they solve a problem.)

Computability Theory - This theory deals primarily with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer.

Complexity Theory - This theories considers not only whether a problem can be solved at all on a computer, but also how efficiently the problem can be solved.

- Symbol: 'a', 'b', '1', '2', etc.
- Alphabet(Σ) - a non-empty, finite set of symbols.
-String: A string over an alphabet Σ is a finite sequence of concatenated symbols, e.g 1212, 01101, baab, etc.
- Language : A set of strings of symbols of the alphabet.  
OR 
•A language over an alphabet is a set of strings over that alphabet.

- Automata : An abstract machine that automatically recognizes if a string belongs to the language or not.

-Deterministic Finite (-state) Automata 
• Informally, a DFA (Deterministic Finite State Automaton) is a simple machine that reads an input string -- one symbol at a time -- and then, after the input has been completely read, decides 
whether to accept or reject the input.
• Formal Definition - 
A Deterministic Finite State Automaton (DFA) is 
a 5-tuple : 
• Q is a finite set of states. 
• Σ is the non-empty finite set of symbols
• d is the state transition function.
• qo is the start state 
• F is the set of accepting /final states. 
- Regular Language: A language that is accepted by a FA.
- Grammar : A set of production rules that describe how to generate all possible strings in the language.

2/26/24, 6:47 AM - +234 903 530 1248: *Definition of terms and concepts in CSC 311*
	Theory of Computation is a branch of Computer Science that deals with *whether and how efficient* a problem can be solved on a model of computation using an algorithm.
	TOC is divided into three categories; Automata theory, computability theory and computational complexiy theory.
	Automata theory is the study of abstract machines or “abstract mathematical machines” and the computational problems that can be solved using the machines. The most powerful model of automata is *Turing machine*.
	Computability theory deals with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer. This is when the computer can address the problem, but it is unable to come with the solution.
	Computational complexity theory considers not only whether a problem can be solved at all on a computer, but also how *efficiently* the problem can be solved. It discusses the efficiency with which a problem could be solved by considering *two major aspects*: *Time complexity and space complexity*. These are measurements of the number of steps needed to analyze and solve the problem and thus determine the memory space that is required in order to solve the problem.
	Grammar is a set of rules that define the structure of strings in a language. *Grammars are used to generate strings in a language* or recognize whether a given string belongs to a particular language.
	The set of all strings derived from a grammar is said to be the *LANGUAGE* generated from that grammar.
	Grammar is a 4-tuple; G = (V, T, S, P). [1] V, The finite set of objects called Variables. [2] T, The finite set of objects called terminal symbols, [3] S, the start variable (And S is a member of V), [4] P, The finite set of production rules or productions.
	Symbols are indivisible entities or objects that cannot be define, they are the atoms of the world of languages. E.g a, 0, 1, b
	An alphabet is a finite, *nonempty* set of symbols. *The alphabet of a language is normally denoted by Σ*. E.g Σ = {0, 1}	Σ = {a, b}
	A string or word over an alphabet Σ is a finite sequence of concatenated symbols of that alphabet Σ. E.g w = abb, x = 001. *An empty string is denoted by ε*
	A language is a set of strings. A language over an alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ*. E.g L = {00, 01, 10, 11}. *An empty language is denoted by ϕ*
	Automata is an algorithm or program that automatically recognizes whether or not a string belongs to a particular language by checking the grammar of the string. *Plural: Automata. Singular: Automaton*
	A _state of a system_ is an instantaneous description of that system which gives relevant information necessary to determine how the system can evolve from that point on.
	_Transitions_ are changes of states that can occur spontaneously or in response to inputs to the states.
	A system that contains *finite number of states and transitions* is called a _finie-state transition system_.
	Finite-state transition systems can be modelled absractly by a mathematical model called *finite automata*.
	A deterministic finite automata is a simple machine that reads an input string --one symbol at a time— and then, after the input has been completely read, it decides whether to *accept or reject* the input. It contains three components: A tape that holds the input string, A tape head for reading the symbols from that tape and A control which itself also contains three things; A finite number s of states, a current state, initially set to start state and a state transition function for changing the state.
	*Formally*, a DFA is a 5-tuple; M=(Q,Σ,δ,q0, F). 
	Q is a finite set of states
	Σ is a finite set of input symbols or alphabets.
	δ is the ‘next state’ transition function.
	q0  ϵ Q is the start state
	F ⊑Q is the set of accept or final states
	A regular expression is formal or concise way to describe a set of strings. It can represent regular languages, which are the *simplest type of languages in the chomsky hierarchy*. Common operations in regular expression include *concatenation, union, and closure (Kleene star) *. E.g The regular expression (a+b)* represents the set of all strings consisting of zero or more ‘a’s and ‘b’s.
	*Formal Definition*, let S be an alphabet. The regular expressions are defined recursively as follows.
Basis:
	ϕ  is a RE
	ϵ is a RE
	∀ a ∈ S. a is RE
These are called *primitive regular expression. i.e Primitive Constituents*
Recursive step:
If r1 and r2¬ are RE, then so are
	r1 + r2¬ 
	r1r2¬
	r1*
	(r1)

2/26/24, 11:02 AM - +234 816 205 8786: The man already said anytime we will do the test and there's no other free week for test apart from this week. Okay, what if now the lecturer come to class and say we'll write test, will that not be an impromptu test? Will everyone be okay with that?  So I think it's a good idea to ask and know if we'll be having test, so as to prepare ahead. 

Sorry if I offend you in any way with my words, I just share my thoughts regarding this.

Thanks!

As we stand here on the brink of this final match, I am filled with immense pride and excitement. Today is not just another game; it is the culmination of months of hard work, dedication, and perseverance.

*To the players, I want to say this:* As you step onto that field, remember the countless hours of sweat and sacrifice that have brought you here. Believe in yourselves, trust in your abilities, and play with all your heart.

*To the students who will be coming to support us*, your energy and enthusiasm are our driving force. Your cheers fuel our determination, and your belief in us inspires us to give our all.

Today, let us leave everything on the field. Let us play with passion, with unity, and with the unwavering belief that victory is within our grasp. No matter the challenges we face, no matter the obstacles in our path, let us stand together as one team, one family, and show the world the strength of our spirit.

Go out there and play your hearts out. Bring home the victory!

Thank you,
Ogunyomi Ayomide

3/5/24, 6:26 PM - +234 905 533 0315: @2349035301248 for No 3...Are you sure the computational power of DFA and NFA are equivalent?
3/5/24, 6:27 PM - Emmanuel: You dey question our scholar?
3/5/24, 6:28 PM - +234 704 981 2103: What did chatgpt tell you?
3/5/24, 6:28 PM - +234 905 533 0315: NFA is more powerful 🫠

3/5/24, 6:33 PM - +234 903 530 1248: As far as computational power is concerned. They both recognize the same language (Regular Language) But NFA represent some regular languages more concisely than DFA.
3/5/24, 6:33 PM - +234 807 772 7914: You have an option
3/5/24, 6:33 PM - +234 905 533 0315: So which means NFA is more powerful,yeah?
3/5/24, 6:35 PM - +234 807 772 7914: Sharp
3/5/24, 6:35 PM - +234 903 530 1248: Not so sure because computational power is measured by the class of languages an Automaton can recognize.
3/5/24, 6:37 PM - +234 905 533 0315: Not so sure..hmmn..no problem sha...thanks
3/5/24, 6:38 PM - +234 903 530 1248: I will appreciate if others can contribut to it sha. Maybe someone else can help us clarify this.

The google drive link access will be made public by evening so it can be beneficial to everyone. Each person’s score is crucial at this point. So pls, halt any payment henceforth.

If you encounter any issue uploading your own project on the google drive, send me your project to my DM and your details, I’ll volunteer to upload for you. 

Lastly, I will meet with the lecturer today to extend the submission deadline till Friday so all issues can be solved and assure everyone gets their project on the drive.

To those that contributed, thanks for the service to yourself and humanity ❤️

3/13/24, 1:58 PM - +234 811 458 2544: The given macro instructions define a macro called "ADD2" that takes two parameters, X and Y. Here's a line-by-line explanation:

1. `MACRO`: This keyword indicates the beginning of a macro definition.

2. `ADD2 X, Y`: This line declares the macro named "ADD2" with two parameters, X and Y. The macro is intended to add the values of X and Y.

3. `LOAD Y`: This line is part of the macro body. It instructs to load the value stored in the memory location represented by the parameter Y.

4. `ADD X`: This line is also part of the macro body. It adds the value stored in the memory location represented by the parameter X to the accumulator or another designated register.

5. `STORE Y`: This line is part of the macro body as well. It stores the result of the addition back into the memory location represented by the parameter Y.

6. `ENDMACRO`: This keyword indicates the end of the macro definition.

In summary, the "ADD2" macro takes two parameters, X and Y, loads the value of Y from memory, adds the value of X to it, and then stores the result back into the memory location represented by Y. This macro can be used as a reusable and convenient way to perform a specific addition operation in assembly language programming.

3/13/24, 2:12 PM - +234 705 493 6008: # Notes on 325

# Assemblers

One-pass Assembler:

- Scans the program once to create the binary program.
- Pass 1:
    - Identifies symbols and opcodes, recording them in a symbol table.
    - Processes pseudo instructions.
    - Checks validity of opcodes and identifies errors.
    - If errors found, prints listing with errors and suppresses second pass; otherwise, resumes.

Two-pass/Multi-pass Assembler:

- Translates assembly language program into machine language in two passes or more.
- Pass 2:
    - Translates opcodes into numeric values.
    - Generates machine code for literals and symbols.
    - Substitutes machine code for assembly code and converts symbol addresses into binary.
    - Repeats steps for each source statement, with resulting object code typically output to auxiliary storage for later execution.

# Addressing mode

### Addressing Modes:

Addressing modes specify how operands' effective addresses are represented in instructions. They provide flexibility in defining complex addresses efficiently.

1. **Register Addressing:** Operands are stored in registers specified by the instruction.
2. **Immediate Addressing:** Operand's value is directly in the instruction.
3. **Memory Addressing:**
    - **Direct:** Operand's address is in the instruction.
    - **Indirect:** Address in the instruction points to the location containing operand's address.
4. **Register Indirect Addressing:** Operand's offset is in a register specified by the instruction.
5. **Auto Indexed Mode:** Operand's effective address is in a register, automatically incremented after access.
6. **Auto Decrement Mode:** Operand's effective address is in a register, automatically decremented before access.
7. **Direct/ Absolute Addressing:** Operand's offset is in the instruction itself.
8. **Indirect Addressing:**
    - **Register Indirect:** Register contains address of operand in memory.
    - **Memory Indirect:** Memory contains address of operand in memory.
9. **Indexed Addressing:** Offset is sum of index register and displacement.
10. **Based Indexed Addressing:** Offset is sum of base register and index register.
11. **Displacement Addressing:** Offset is added to the address part of the instruction.
12. **PC Relative Addressing:** Effective address is obtained by adding displacement to the program counter.
13. **Relative Addressing:** Effective address is obtained by adding displacement to the program counter.

### Purpose of Addressing Modes:

- Provide versatility to programming.
- Reduce bits in addressing field of instruction.

### Instruction Cycle:

1. **Fetch Instruction:** Instruction fetched from memory and stored in instruction register.
2. **Decode Instruction:** Decoder interprets instruction.
3. **Read Effective Address:** Effective address read from memory if needed.
4. **Execute Instruction:** Control unit sends signals to execute instruction.

Cycle repeats for next instruction.

In summary, addressing modes facilitate efficient operand access in instructions, enhancing programming flexibility, and the instruction cycle involves fetching, decoding, reading effective address, and executing instructions repeatedly.

# Memory Management

### Memory Management:

Memory management oversees the allocation and deallocation of memory resources for programs, ensuring efficient utilization while meeting various requirements.

**1. Relocation:**

- Memory is shared among multiple processes, necessitating dynamic allocation.
- Swapping processes in and out of memory may require relocation to different memory areas.
- Logical addresses in programs must be translated to physical addresses after loading into memory.

**2. Protection:**

- Prevents unauthorized access to memory spaces of other processes.
- Trade-off between relocation and protection as satisfying relocation complicates protection.
- Dynamic address calculation at runtime is common, making absolute address checks at compile time impossible.

**3. Sharing:**

- Allows multiple processes to access the same memory portion.
- Facilitates efficient use of memory resources by sharing common data or code segments.
- Memory management ensures controlled access to shared areas without compromising protection.

**4. Logical Organization:**

- Main memory typically organized as a linear address space.
- Supports modular organization of programs, with different modules having varying protection levels.
- Modules can be shared among processes, enhancing resource utilization and flexibility.

**5. Physical Organization:**

- Main memory is fast but limited and volatile, while secondary memory provides long-term storage.
- Overlaying technique utilized when main memory is insufficient, allowing modules to share memory regions.
- In a multiprogramming environment, space allocation in main memory is dynamic and may vary.

In summary, memory management ensures efficient utilization of memory resources by dynamically allocating and deallocating memory, addressing relocation, protection, sharing, and organizing memory logically and physically.

# Macro Processor

Macro processors are tools that allow programmers to define shorthand representations of code sequences, known as macros, which can be called elsewhere in the code. This improves efficiency by reducing code duplication and facilitating updates.

An example scenario illustrates the utility of macros: in a system lacking a direct "add" instruction, macros can be defined to mimic such functionality using existing instructions like "load" and "store."

Macro expansion can be done through macro assemblers or macro preprocessors. Assemblers expand macros into assembly language statements and then assemble the program, while preprocessors solely handle macro expansion.

Three examples of macro processors are those designed for assembler language, high-level programming languages, and general-purpose use. These processors recognize, save, and expand macro definitions and calls.

Standard linkers like MS-DOS Linker for x86 systems, SunOS Linkers for SPARC systems, and Cray MPP Linkers for massively parallel processing systems provide functionalities like combining object modules, resolving symbols, and preparing executables for runtime.

In summary, macro processors streamline code writing and maintenance, while linkers facilitate the creation of executable programs from object modules, tailored to different architectures.

It's advisable to leave it for a while and let the team sort it out.

4/4/24, 4:28 PM - TheTerabyte: Good evening guys.
So I went around yesterday as a lot of people have asked me if I knew anywhere in Ilorin.
If you’re still looking for somewhere, this is like what we have here.

1. Softrays (Everyone knows this place, they collect 11k, the environment is not really giving sha, I don’t think they have 24/7 electricity as well, light no dey when I go, but again it’s 11k. Go on Mon, Wed and Fri.
2. ⁠MacLords: MacLords is a 100 naira keke from post office, nice place, 24/7 electricity, no WiFi but network there is great, and the place is quiet and okay. It actually is! Then, it is 40k for the 6 months, go three times, Mon - Wed, Resume on the 22nd. You can go on other days to do your personal stuffs too and these ones dey even close by night night!
3. ⁠MalHub, this is the best one I saw, comes with the highest price as well, prices vary for each course but I think UI and Front end was 55k, data something something was like 120k. But they have a wide range of skills available. And you can resume anytime. Classes happen 3 times a week, Mon - Wed. But you can go Thursday to Saturday to do your personal stuff. They also have a fast WiFi but you have to pay 2500 every month for unlimited access, they ofc have 24/7 electricity. This one is also an #100 bike from post office.
4. ⁠Harmony Hub, this place I don’t really know but it exists I think they are good too, it’s not far from Shoprite at all. That’s all I know. 

Please let know if anyone has questions. Just ask here.
4/4/24, 5:57 PM - +234 906 570 6942: 5. Codesquad: It's beside Polaris bank at Post office. Its the second floor above a restaurant. They have electricity and wifi connection. I don't know if the electricity is 24/7. Their fee is 25k which covers data and electricity.  I think classes should be Mon to Friday. It's not as conducive as Malhub


@2348142452186 is right 
Malhub has the best environment hence the price📈
